About me

I am a student at Karpagam Institute of Technology, 
where I am now in my third year of a BE in computer science and engineering.
I enjoy meeting new people and seeing new perspectives. 
Also have basic knowledge about programing.
I like discussing technology or Stock market or other things. 
Of course there is a lot to learn, a lot of problems to solve and a lot more to build on.
So far and for what I got, I'm very grateful.
